# Youtube-Analysis-Model
A YouTube Analysis Model that studies video performance using upload time, engagement metrics, and channel behavior. It identifies patterns in views, likes, and audience activity, helping creators understand which factors drive growth and which upload hours or content types perform best.

This project presents a complete YouTube Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes key performance metrics extracted from a dataset containing YouTube videos, channels, engagement statistics, and publishing patterns. It is designed to help creators, analysts, and marketers understand how different factors influence video performance and audience engagement.

The dashboard provides an intuitive and visually structured overview of YouTube trends across multiple channels, allowing users to compare channel performance, analyze engagement ratios, track viewership patterns over time, and study which content types or channels generate higher interactions. With interactive filters, the user can select a specific channel and analyze its detailed performance metrics, including the average views, likes, comments, and the publishing date of selected videos.

The layout includes carefully chosen visuals that highlight both high-level summaries and deeper analytical views. KPI cards at the top of the dashboard display key metrics such as average view count, average like count, average comment count, and publish date. These KPIs give immediate insight into overall dataset performance or selected channel performance.

The dashboard includes two primary analytical charts. The first chart, “Avg Views, Like by Channel,” compares average views with total likes across different channels, highlighting both high-performing channels and channels with disproportionately high engagement ratios. This visualization helps identify channels that consistently produce high-impact content. The second chart, “View By Year,” shows the trend of total views and comments across years, revealing how YouTube content consumption has evolved over time and showcasing spikes in engagement.

A table visual has also been integrated to provide a granular view of individual videos. It includes channel names, thumbnail previews, view counts, and like counts. This allows users to interactively explore content performance at the video level and understand how specific videos contribute to overall channel performance.

This dashboard is built with a strong focus on clarity, insight, and ease of exploration. Every visual has been selected to provide maximum analytical value with minimal complexity. The bright red theme is inspired by the YouTube brand, ensuring a clean and recognizable visual identity.
